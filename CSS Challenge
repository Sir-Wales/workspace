        <h1>The coolest creature</h1>

        <p>The <em>Penguin</em> is awesome because <strong>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family Spheniscidae of the order Sphenisciformes.
             They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, is found north of the Equator.
             Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming.
             Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming.
             A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.</strong>.
            <em>They spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.</em>
