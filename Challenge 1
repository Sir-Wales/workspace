        <h1>Journey Under Starlight</h1>
        <p>Beneath the sky so vast and wide,<br>
Where shadows dance and dreams reside,<br>
A whisper stirs, a secret song,<br>
Of where weâ€™re from and where we belong.<br>
Like rivers meet the open sea,<br>
We find our path, we wander free,<br>
Through twists and turns, both dark and light,<br>
Guided always by starlit night.</p>
